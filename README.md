#                                (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ WELCOME TO QUINTON'S SPU GITHUB✧: *ヽ(◕ヮ◕ヽ)
Hello! My name is *Quinton Pho*, freshman undergraduate student at Seattle Pacific University. As of now, I am pursuing a Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science and a Bachelors of Arts in Business Administration: Marketing. I hope to use my education in both to find a career in the consumer field! This could be in game design, web design, UI/UX design, or anything design related really (I just like making things). I mainly program in C++ right now, though I have dabbled slightly in Java and Python.
